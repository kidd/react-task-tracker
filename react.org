  - for => htmlFor

  - allows defaults
  - allows requireds
  - allows "typechecks"
  - by default props are passed as strings, unless you foo={1} to pass js objects

    elements, you wrap everything into a dummy =<> </>=

* components' state
  2 ways of defining components. Class based and function based.
  Function components used to be "dummy", and work only for stateless

  complex components. But not anymore. With hooks, functional
  components can be full featured.
